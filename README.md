# Presentation template for Remark.js

This is a template for presentations (in the humanities â€“ so no math) using Remark. For information on **Remark.js** see [here](http://remarkjs.com).

## How to use

You need to download ```remark-latest.min.js``` frome [here](https://gnab.github.io/remark/downloads/remark-latest.min.js). Besides, the template uses ```remark-zoom.js```, which you have to download from [here](https://github.com/William-Yeh/remark-zoom).

To use the template, you only have to edit the file ```source.md```. If you like to change the template, you have to edit ```presentation-template.html```. 

To screen the presentation locally, you need a webserver as described [here](https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki#external-markdown). I use
```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000```.

## Thanks
